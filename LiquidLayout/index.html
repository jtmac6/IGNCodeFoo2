				A liquid layout is a web page layout where elements on the page resize themselves to fit several different resolutions.  This is usually acheived by using css and specifying the widths of all the elements on the page with percentages.  This eliminates the need for horizontal scroll bars which can make viewing a web page cumbersome.  Some more complex liquid layouts also incorporate javascript to detect the resolution of the browser window and adjust the page accordingly. In general the main goal of a liquid layout is to make your site viewable on as many devices as possible.  However, the most important reason for which I would use a liquid layout would be to make my site ergonomic, intuitive, and easy to view for as many people as possible.  I think that this is of utmost importance because if the end user cannot easily navigate through my site and view the content that interests them, then they won't continue visiting my site.
